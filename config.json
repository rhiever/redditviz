For example, if two subreddits both had links to a particular YouTube video posted to them, that would count as an association.This map was created from data on all the links posted to reddit between Thu, 23 Jun 2005 18:50:02 UTC and Thu, 28 Mar 2013 01:24:17 UTC, which was kindly provided by Reddit user <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/reddit.com\/user\/deimorz\">Deimorz<\/a>.<\/p><p>The size of a subreddit on the map relates to the number of subscribers (as of June 29th 2013). Only reddits with 100 or more subscribers are included. Subscriber information for some closed and private subreddits was not available so these communities may be absent from the graph.<\/p><p>Associations are only shown if there are at least 4 xposts since the first reddit post in 2005.<\/p><br \/><p>For more information on the original discussion that led to the creation of this map, as well as more information on how it was created, please go to the <a href=\"..\/\">main page<\/a>.<\/p><br /><p>This page was created by reddit user sharkbait784 in July 2013.
